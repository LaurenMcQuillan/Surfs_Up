# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to convince W. Avy to invest in a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu. W. Avy is already considering investing, but he had previously invested in a surf shop in Oahu without considering the weather of the location of the shop, and the shop was forced to close. This time, W. Avy will need to look at weather analysis in order to be convinced to invest.  Specifically, he would like to consider temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the Surf and Shake shop will be sustainable throughout the year.

## Results

1.	Oahu in June has an average temperature of 74.94 degrees, a maximum temperature of 85.00 degrees, and a minimum temperature of 64.00 degrees. These statistics lead me to believe that even though June is a summer month, Oahu does not get too unbearably hot, and in fact has perfect weather that would encourage people to want to get out and surf and visit an ice cream shop.

2.	Oahu in December has an average temperature of 71.04 degrees, a maximum temperature of 83.00 degrees, and a minimum temperature of 56.00 degrees.  Even with this being a winter month, these weather statistics show that in Oahu, winter is not too cold to get out and surf.

3.	When comparing June temperature data to December temperature data, the temperatures do not vary drastically between the two months, which leads me to think that the temperature in Oahu is fairly consistent year-round.

## Summary

Based on the temperature summary statistics for the months of June and December, it would be sustainable year-round to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu.  The average, maximum, and minimum temperatures do not fluctuate too drastically between the month of June and December. It would also be beneficial to look at the precipitation data for Oahu in the months of June and December to determine if one season gets more rain than the other, which could be bad for business. This could be achieved by adding 2 additional queries to the analysis.
